**This part is the TypeScript runtime scripts bundled with the ReactorUMG plugin, published as an NPM package.**
Here is the English translation of the text:

🚀 Quick Start

-   **Install Dependencies:** npm install
-   **Run Unit Tests:** npm test (Uses Mocha + c8, reports output to coverage/)
-   **Build Artifacts:** npm run build
-   **Code Linting:** npm run lint
-   **Publish to NPM:**
    1.  First, log in: npm login
    2.  Adjust the version number as needed: npm version [patch|minor|major]
    3.  Then publish: npm publish
    - *Tip: You can also directly execute npm run newversion to automatically increment the patch version and publish.*

ReactorUMG helps you build **UMG** game UI and editor UI in Unreal Engine using **React**.
The plugin is built on **PuertTS** scripting and pairs with AI assistance so you can develop and iterate UI efficiently with a web-style workflow. **It is especially suited to using AI to quickly build a variety of in-editor UI tools.**

> **Keywords:** Unreal Engine, UE5, UMG, UI, Slate, React, TypeScript, Plugin, Hot Reload, Live Preview, Puerts

⚠️ **Alpha stage**: The API and structure may still change; an official version will be released once stabilized. Given that in-game UIs typically have high visual and interactive complexity, the current version of the plugin still has limitations in adaptation completeness and cannot fully meet the presentation requirements of production-level game UIs. **Therefore, at this stage, we strongly recommend prioritizing its application to UI development for editor extension tools, to improve tool development efficiency.***

⚠️ **Before you start**: Please read the FAQ first to avoid known pitfalls.

<h2 id="ca757ae1">Why use ReactorUMG</h2>

UMG is powerful, but it lacks a text-first, programmable front-end ecosystem, making it hard to plug into AI and front-end engineering practices (componentization, hot reload, static checks, automated testing, etc.). That slows teams who need quick iteration.
To solve this, we built the ReactorUMG plugin. **ReactorUMG** lets you use **native React + TypeScript + AI** to quickly build game UI or editor UI. It is WYSIWYG, supports live preview and hot reload while editing, and connects modern web front-end practices to game UI development.

---

<h2 id="d2ffce75">Core Features</h2>

+ **Native React experience**: Supports React Hooks, function/class components, TSX syntax, React container layouts, React native components, and UMG components.
+ **Scriptable interaction**: Use PuerTS to call engine and editor scripting interfaces as a Blueprint substitute.
+ **AI-assisted development**: Use AI Coding to quickly build editor tool panels, runtime UI, and reusable component libraries.
+ **Live preview**: Hot-reload validation and in-editor live preview to verify layout and interaction quickly.
+ **Comprehensive examples**: Samples and templates from beginner to advanced.
+ **UI animation**: Import Spine and Rive UI animations.

---

<h2 id="19c93d0a">Development System Requirements</h2>

+ Unreal Engine **5.x**
+ **Node.js >= 18** and **Yarn / PNPM / NPM** (choose one)
+ VSCode / Cursor (recommended)
+ Windows 10/11, Linux

---

<h2 id="2e52a2da">Install and Quick Start</h2>

**Minimal Setup**

+ Download the plugin and place it in the project's Plugins directory;
+ Run the initialization script setup_win.bat;
+ Launch the project, create a ReactorUMG->EditorUtilityWidget asset, and write UI scripts under <ProjectDir>/TypeScript/<ProjectName>/Editor/<AssetName>.

See the docs: https://caleb196x.github.io/ReactorUMGOnlineDoc/quickstart/

<h2 id="x0qyv">Runtime UI Supported Platforms</h2>

+ Windows, Android, Linux

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

**Q: How does this relate to native UMG/Slate?**
A: ReactorUMG targets teams who build UI with React and complements UMG/Slate; it still relies on UE for UI rendering and the scripting bridge.

**Q: How is performance?**
A: UI complexity and state-change frequency affect performance. Control component granularity, lift state, reduce unnecessary re-renders, and disable debug overhead when needed.
